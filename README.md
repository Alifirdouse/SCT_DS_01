# Bar Chart and Histogram Visualization

This project demonstrates how to create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population, using the World Bank Population dataset.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn (optional, for enhanced visualizations)

Install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Data Source

The World Bank Population dataset contains population data by country, age, gender, and year. Download the dataset from [World Bank Data Portal](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL) or use a pre-downloaded CSV file.

## Features

- **Bar Chart**: Visualizes the distribution of a categorical variable 
- **Histogram**: Visualizes the distribution of a continuous variable
